## About The Project

<div align="center">

</br>
This project aims to reproduce the behavior of a real IRC server in C++ 98. It's a group project i made it with <a href="https://github.com/sur4c1">iCARUS</a>.
It requires us to develop an IRC server that's conform to the IRC standards, so we can connect to it and test it with a real IRC client. We don't have to develop a client, but we chose to use Weechat as our reference client.

Specifically, we have to:

-   Manage many clients without being stucked or blocked
-   Communicate with the clients using TCP/IP protocol
-   It must implement the following features:
    -   Being able to authenticate with a nickname, a username and a realname
    -   Joining a channel
    -   Sending and receiving private messages
    -   Sending and receiving messages to a channel
    -   Having channels operators and basic users
    -   Having all operators specifics commands
    -   exit without any options

As an IRC server, we support the following commands:

-   `NICK` - Change nickname
-   `USER` - Set username and realname
-   `PASS` - Submit password on connect
-   `QUIT` - Quit the server
-   `JOIN` - Join a channel
-   `PART` - Leave a channel
-   `PRIVMSG` - Send a message
-   `TOPIC` - Set or check a channel topic
-   `MODE` - Set or check a user or channel mode
-   `KICK` - Kick a user from a channel
-   `INVITE` - Invite a user to a channel
-   `PING` - Ping the server
-   `NOTICE` - Send a notice

And the `i` channel mode, which allows only invited users to join the channel

We added some bonuses to our server :

-   The `t` channel mode, which allows only operators to change the topic of the channel
-   The ability to send and receive files using the `DCC` command
-   Our fantastic bot, Ratatouille-b0t, who will help you to use our server by answer to your `[...] quoi` messages by `feur` and some others originals surprises !
